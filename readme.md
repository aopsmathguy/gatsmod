as a not if you want to load it in the future
command shift i then reload
it doesn't work unless the console is open when the page loads

It includes 
- aimbot
- thermal (a little glitched but it works)
- bino

You need to have the console open when the webpage loads.
Hold shift to aimbot.
Your mouse needs to be close to the enemy when firing(within 90 degrees)
